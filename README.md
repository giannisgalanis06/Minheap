# MinHeap
This is an implementation of the **MinHeap** data structure in C++ without using the STL
The program reads commands from an input file (`commands.txt`) and outputs results to an output file (`output.txt`).
This implementation was developed as part of a university project.

## Usage

- The files `minheap.h` and `minheap.cpp` contain the MinHeap code.
- You can create your own `main.cpp` to run the MinHeap or use these files as a library in your projects.

## Features

- Implemented without STL.
- Supports basic operations like insert, delete, and find minimum.
